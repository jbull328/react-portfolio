          <h2>The right mix of expeirence and creativity</h2>
          <p>I have worked with distributed teams on large software rollouts in an agile team. I am currently working on FullStack projects and Freelancing. I am interested in working with an Agile team, following scrum practices. I like working with React, Node.JS, Express.js, Javascript, MongoDB, Linux, Git, and AWS. 
          I have been in the business of learning daily and working on a wide range of technologies and projects.
            <br/><br/>
            I worked with a local Meetup for two years, creating the community from the ground up, by hosting consistent monthly meetups, networking and mentoring young developers. 
            That has been a humbling and awesome experience. I got to see people work hard to achieve their goal to go on to do great things. 
            I want to continue to mentor and work with diverse people from different backgrounds on their journey.
            <br/><br/>I have been working in tech for nearly 5 years in various roles, and what I really want is to focus on colaborating with a team and making meaningful improvements to web applications.
             In my career, I have seen how adding a great user experience has really helped the people around me, and Iâ€™m all about people. I want to help, I want to get involved and I want to work hard.
             I would love to add value to your team.</p>
